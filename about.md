<center><i> "The Democratic Party is not a collection of diverse interests brought together only to win elections.
We are united instead by a common heritage of respect for deeds of the past and a recognition of the needs of the future.
Never satisfied with today we have always staked our fortune on tomorrow." </i> <br> <br>

â€” President John F. Kennedy </center>

Meetings take place every month, usually on the second Thursday, but check to make the date hasn't changed.
