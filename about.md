<center>*"The Democratic Party is not a collection of diverse interests brought together only to win elections. 
 We are united instead by a common heritage of respect for deeds of the past and a recognition of the needs of the future.
 Never satisfied with today we have always staked our fortune on tomorrow."*</center>

â€” President John F. Kennedy

We are the Democratic Party of Midland County, Texas. Our party works closely with other county parties in West Texas. Meetings take place every month, usually on the second Thursday, but check to make the date hasn't changed.
