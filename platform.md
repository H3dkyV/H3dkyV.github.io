### PREAMBLE

Texas Democrats believe government exists to achieve together what we cannot achieve as
individuals; and government must serve all people. A representative democracy is only truly
representative if every single citizen is guaranteed the inalienable right to vote in fair and open
elections.

### EQUALITY & FREEDOM
Texas Democrats believe in equal opportunities and freedom for all human beings no matter a
personâ€™s race, disability, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic or
immigration status.

### SMART GOVERNMENT
Texas Democrats believe in a fair criminal justice system serving all people; robust public and
higher education opportunities are critical for our future; and our economy must benefit all
Texans.

### A HEALTHY TEXAS
Texas Democrats believe healthcare is a right; women's rights are human rights; we owe future
generations a clean and healthy planet; and a strong social safety net creates opportunity for all
Americans.
