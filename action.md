2. Fax our Senators' and Congressman's office. The easiest way to do this is to use a free service called [Resistbot](https://resistbot.io/). To use it, text RESIST to 50409. From there you can send a message that will be faxed to them.
3. Register to vote. Go to [Vote.gov](vote.gov) to get a form to fill out and mail in.
4. Set up a Google Alerts for Senator Cornyn, Senator Cruz, Congressman Conaway, Senator Seliger, and Representative Craddick so you know when they're in the news. You can do this by going to [this webpage](google.com/alerts).
6. Read. Local news can be found in the [Midland Reporter-Telegram](mrt.com), and good national news sources are the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com), [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com), and [Politico](http://www.politico.com).
